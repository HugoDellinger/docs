Semaphore provides a webhook configuration portal that allows you to set up and manage notifications for various events related to your account.

## Accessing the Configuration Portal

To access the webhook configuration portal, follow these steps:

1. **Send a POST request** to the following endpoint:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.getsemaphore.com/v1/webhook-portal' \
--header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--data ''
```

- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.
- This request will redirect you to the Svyx portal.

2. **Navigate to the webhook configuration portal**:
   - After executing the request, you will be directed to the Svyx portal where you can configure your webhooks.

## Configuring Your Webhook

Once you're in the Svyx portal, follow these steps to set up your webhook:

1. **Enter your webhook URL**:

   - In the portal, input the URL where you want to receive notifications.

2. **Save the configuration**:
   - Save your settings to activate the webhook.

<Info>Ensure that the endpoint you provide is capable of receiving POST requests, as this is how Semaphore will send notifications.</Info>

## Best Practices

- **Security**: Implement authentication on your webhook endpoint to ensure that only Semaphore can send notifications to it.
- **Reliability**: Your endpoint should respond with a 2xx status code to acknowledge receipt of the webhook. Semaphore may retry failed deliveries.
- **Processing**: Design your webhook receiver to process notifications asynchronously to avoid timeouts.

## Webhook Events

Semaphore can notify you about various events through webhooks. Some common events include:

- Company data updates
- Search results availability
- Document processing completion
