Semaphore provides a comprehensive endpoint to retrieve detailed information about a specific company. This endpoint allows you to request various data points and documents related to the company.

## Available Data Points

When retrieving company data, you can request the following data points:

1. company_profile: Basic company information
2. legal_representatives: Information about company officers
3. ultimate_beneficial_owners: Information about beneficial owners
4. available_documents: List of available official documents

## Retrieving Documents

You can request specific documents by providing their IDs in the "documents" field. These can be:

- Random IDs obtained from the available_documents data point
- Stable quick access IDs for certain documents (e.g., "uncertified_trade_register_extract")

<Info>
  For a detailed list of available quick access document IDs for each country, please refer to our [country coverage
  documentation](/essentials/coverage).

## Response Times and Handling of Asynchronous Data

Response times for company data retrieval can vary depending on the specific registry we need to query:

- Fastest responses: A few hundred milliseconds
- Slowest responses: Up to multiple business days

### Handling Data Not Immediately Available

In some cases, certain data or documents may not be available at the time of the initial request. In such situations:

1. **Initial Response**: The API returns the data that is immediately available.
2. **Webhooks**: Notifications are sent via webhooks when additional data becomes available. Each webhook contains previously sent data as well as the new data.

Multiple webhooks may be triggered for a single request, depending on the time required to retrieve all requested information.

## Retrieve Company Data

```bash Request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.getsemaphore.com/v1/company \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
    "country": "FR",
    "companyNumber": "928020932",
    "dataPoints": [
      "company_profile",
      "legal_representatives",
      "ultimate_beneficial_owners",
      "available_documents"
    ],
    "documents": [
      "uncertified_trade_register_extract"
    ]
  }'
```

The response will include the requested information based on the specified data points and documents.
